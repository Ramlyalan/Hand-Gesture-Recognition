# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Description:

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It captures hand landmarks, classifies gestures such as open palm, fist, and thumbs up using a trained Random Forest model, and displays the predicted gesture on the webcam feed. This can be extended for gesture-based control systems and human-computer interaction applications.
